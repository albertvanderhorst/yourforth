; ---------------- preliminary remark -------------------------
; Normally a Forth in assembly style would use the official assembler
; on the operating system at hand, in our case gas or ``GNU as'' as it is called
; nowadays.
; The one-liner illustrates why we deviate here. A gas equivalent would download 1 Gbyte!
; I use fasm because it has overwhelming advantages.
; By implication the following advantages point to disadvantages of gas.
; 1. fasm accommodates one simple segment
; 2. fasm accommodates Intel syntax fairly
; 3. fasm has a traditional macro facilitiy
; 4. fasm needs no linking step
; 5. fasm is small, basically an executable.
; Also it accomodates symbol reassignment and labels that are local to macro's,
; which is kind of essential to the way we want to use macro's.

; -------------------- introduction ------------------------------------
; A famous chess player once stated that, if we were to find aliens living on
; another planet, we should expect that they will play Go. Likewise
; discovering Forth is something every civilisation in the universe will
; do eventually. Chuck Moore claims to have discovered, rather than invented, Forth.
; You'll find the structure of yourforth simple, and compelling.

; The model for Forth is the stored program computer, actually the best invention since
; sliced bread. The first computers had a work area where numbers were stored, and
; punched card that represented the instructions. Then someone came with the idea, to
; have one memory space, and store numbers there, but also put the program in the
; same space and then have the computer read the instructions from memory.
; Now a small programm can write a larger program, and then execute it!
; It is is similar to how the human brain continuously reconditions its synapses
; in a perpetual learning process. At last a machine with the potential of artificial
; intelligence was born. So a memory item is identified by a number,
;  the "address" of the memory item.
; The first program-building program was probably an assembler, but at the time the larger
;  program could not be deposited into memory and had to punched onto tape.
; Guess what? It is still done this way, only the tape has been replaced
; by disk files or EPROM. Only the artificial-intelligence-languages,
; LISP and Forth, allow to have a program that extends itself
; indefinitely. Interestingly, you will find that most programs cripple
; the computer, by separating into a text and a data segment, the
; equivalent of the punched card and the work area of above. Not so in
; Forth, were data and code belonging together remain close.
; It is hard to instruct a traditional compiler like GNU's to have such a
; unified memory space. It is illustrative that the option for the linker is
; called -magic and it is is probably only there, because Richard
; Stalman is a fan of that other ai-capable language, LISP. This applies
; to GNU as. Of course what we want is simple, and with fasm doing
; simple things is easy.

; The first c-compiler in existance was written in assembler (what else?)
; but then immediately they rewrote the compiler in c.
; Likewise a PL-1 compiler is written in PL-1, an algol68 compiler
; is written in algol68. Can't a Forth be written in Forth?
; Actually it is! It is even easier. If you want to add features to a c-compiler
; you must edit the source and rebuild it. Being an interpreter yourforth
; just can include a Forth source file with the facilities
; you want. Only the kernel here has to be written in assembler,
; like the first c-compiler ever.
; Even in this assembler source you will see that most of the code is actually
; Forthcode, that is compiled by the assembler (with a renaming convention).
; Forth is the only language simple enough to make this feasible.

; Memory consists of bytes
; and, yes, nothing funny, that are the bytes you buy in the store.
; Those bytes are numbered, and thus identified, and they
; can be used for data or code, as I choose.
; yourforth uses memory between BM and EM. (exercise)
; So you can use the byte addressed as BM, as BM+1, up till and including EM-1,
; but not EM.
; Bytes can represent characters, small pictures that are associated
; with sounds (in most languages) or concepts in e.g. chinese.
; Chunks of bytes are needed to represent numbers as large as BM.
; We take 4 bytes together to form a cell, resulting in a 32-bit Forth,
; and restricting memory size to 4 Gbyte. Now we can manipulate
; fairly large numbers, of plus or minus 2000 millions, and addresses
; (which are just numbers)
; up to ca. 2 Gbyte. We will shun negative addresses in yourforth.

; The word "word" has a special meaning in Forth, so using official Forth jargon
; "cell" for those chunks diminishes confusion.

cw      =     4                 ; Cell width

; 32 bits also happens to be the word size of the processor we are using, or more
; precisely -- because it is probably a 64-bit processor -- of the wordsize we
; are instructing the processor to use.

        use32

; This is not enough, Linux must know that this is a 32 bit (ELF)
; executable (not ELF64), to start the program in the right mode.
; This is the way to instruct fasm to put such a header at the front
; of our program.

        FORMAT  ELF EXECUTABLE ; fasm makes an executable directly, no linker.

; We are not particularly interested at what address Forth starts, as long as
; we have enough bytes to work with, and
; that's what we define here. It is made to work, by declaring the right amount
; of space.
; (exercise)
;
forthsize      =     (0x100000)   ; One megabyte, for starters.
;
tasksize    = 0x10000           ; Total size of the uninitialised memory near EM
stacksize   = tasksize/4        ;  Its subdivisions.
cibsize     = tasksize/2

; Forth is an interpreter, an environment that you can type commands into
; to get them executed.
; Characters are glyph's, the bitmaps on the screen, that are associated
; with the content of one byte.
; Forth doesn't care much what the console
; shows you, nor what content results from pressing a particular key.
; Internally only rows of bytes are compared, and build up,
; and they are passed to the console for display.
; The typing and the showing of results goes through
; a "console" which is typically a terminal window on a Linux X-screen, but
; could equally well be an old fashoned VT100 terminal connected with a
; 100 m RS232 line. Linux has the convenient notions of a "standard input" and
; a "standard output" with facilities to use them. We let Linux take care of
; how this i/o is setup, and within Forth we just use it.
; The character encoding doesn't count for much in Forth, but you can see that
; this file is in UTF-8. The inventor of Forth, Chuck Moore uses a Huffman
; encoding of his whim for colorforth. Exercise.

; This brings us to the subject of the interface with the Operating
; System. The interfacing with Linux is brutally direct. We use the system calls,
; that have been given numbers. Each performs a basic functionality, e.g.
; the open system call opens a file.
; Their documentation shows on commands like "man 2 exit".

__NR_exit    =     0x1
__NR_open    =     0x5
__NR_close   =     0x6
__NR_creat   =     0x8
__NR_unlink  =     0xa
__NR_chdir   =     0xc
__NR_read    =     0x3
__NR_select  =     0x52
__NR_newselect      =     0x8e
__NR_write   =     0x4
__NR_ioctl   =     0x36
__NR_ioperm  =     0x65
__NR_iopl    =     0x6e
__NR_lseek   =     0x13
__NR_execve  =     0xb
__NR_fork    =     0x2
__NR_waitpid =     0x7
__NR_pipe    =     0x2a

; See XOS of how the dispatching takes place.
; The numbers have been copied from a secret place in Linux's include hierarchy (exercise)
; and the exact names are retained, which means an exception to the naming convention
; that words containing capitals or underscores are Forth names.
;

; Experienced assembler programmers expect two segments, one that we will fill
; with our forth code, and one unitialized that may be very large.
; (We could get by with one segment if we don't mind to have 1 Gbyte executables.)
; The first segment would be marked BITS (or some such), and the second one NOBIT,
; and while linking we
; would have made sure that they fit snugly together. Now this is a bit silly,
; because the assembler perfectly knows that the NOBITS part is not initialised.
; Surprise! fasm doesn't have this nonsensical keyword. Not only doesn't it store
; the content of segments without content, it doesn't store the unitialised part
; of segments. We can put everything in
; one segment, and the unitialised part occupies no room on our hard disk.
; <explanation of linking>

               segment executable readable writable
bm:                     ; This is the first address of Forth.
; As said, we are not particularly interested in what address bm represents and don't
; force the assemblers hand.

; You probably know a little bit how an interpreter works. Contrary to a compiler
; that may inspect a whole file, it takes the input one word at a time.
; In Forth word's are separated by blank space. The word is looked up in a list,
; and it is executed, which means that it gets in control. There is no "interpreter
; loop" that sniffs the word out, and refuses it if it is no good. No. You type
; "DROP" and if it's there, you get it. The Intel program counter is set
; to the machine code of "DROP" and the ship sails.
; Not all that we want the interpreter to understands can be put in the list, e.g.
; we can't put all 32 bit numbers there. There are other notations for
; expressions that are known at compile time and constant : "aap" 1234 0x1234.
; We'll call those denotations.
; The solution for denotations, is that it sufficient to have a partial
; or ambiguous match. yourforth requires that the first characters are
; recognized, so it can handle a 0x1234 notation for hexadecimal but not
; Intel's 1234H.
; Being a prefix is merely a property of the Forth definition and it doesn't
; make looking up a word all that harder.
; So, if the first part of a word matches a prefix definition in the
; list, e.g. " for strings, then the definition with name `` " ''
; is executed. For you new to Forth, a string consisting of one double
; quote is a perfectly good Forth name. Get used to it!
; It itself takes care of parsing the remainder of the denotation.
; At the very end of the list we have a catch-all, which always matches,
; because it is the empty string. This interprets the string as a
; number. I admit, this is a bit of a trick.

; Now the intelligent part. You can use the Forth system to extend itself by
; instructing the interpreter to add a new command to the list.
; We will discuss that later in great detail. For now let's sketch how
; the dictionary looks. It is basically a list of Forth words, each with
; a header. The list is expandable, and the most recent word is highest
; in memory. In Forth you can redefine a word, then it hides a word of
; that same name that might exist. You get a warning, but it is not an
; error. In this way you can replace a word with a version with
; debugging information, you can use the old version to build the word.
; In interactive sessions this feature is often used to correct
; mistakes. Oops, forgot a carriage return. Let me just redefine it
; as itself plus a carriage return.
;
; Forth definitions despite their division in categories like colon
; definitions, variables, constants, cd-objects are uniform. Zooming in
; we see the header, a structure with 5 fields each of one cell,
; followed by memory that is owned by this definition, then the
; following header. What is in the memory is up to the definition. You
; may consider this Forth's version of an object. If there is one thing
; to remember about objects that is that objects have a character and an
; identity. An objects character, its type or class, is determined by
; its behaviour or code. The identity of an object is determined by the
; data it carries. Likewise Forth's object have a code field and a data
; field. If you are into objects, you may associate the code field with
; methods and the data fields with fields in traditional objects. You
; will however discover that Forth is uncannily concrete and precise.
;
; The list mechanism requires a link field. This starts at the most
; recent word. Its link contains the address of the header of the
; previous definition, and so on, and the last definition contains a
; zero. Then of course there is one field for the name. The flag field
; with bits up for miscellaneous properties, brings the field count to 5.
;
; So let's summarize.
; A definition consist of a header with 5 fields CDFLN and its data
; area. The definitions together make up the memory up to a point that
; moves up when adding new definitions. Then we have free
; memory up till the end of a reserved with a few scratch area's notably
; the stack.
;
; The name is not very essential. You can change the name of any
; definition in a working program and it keeps working all
; the same. A definition can only be found if you know the name, of
; course. (EXERCISE!)
;
; The link field also is not. It is only used by the interpreter to look
; up a definition. A typical application program will never inspect link
; fields. Set them all to zero and the program keeps working fine. A
; definition can only be found if it is linked in properly, so the
; compilation of that program cannot succeed. In fact the : definition
; that starts compilation cannot be found. Exercise.
;
; The flag field contains a bit up for properties a word might have. For
; example it may be hidden, which means that it must be ignored during a
; lookup. Exercise.
;
; More essential is the data field. All but the basic instruction of the
; Forth engine have data, associated: a constant value, a buffer
; address, a structure with fields. Als note that most Forth code is
; interpreted. The interpreted code is data, not machine code. Exercise.
;
; Absolutely essential is the code field. This contains an address and
; the genuine Intel Program counter is directly and unconditionally
; loaded with that address if the definition is called upon. If that
; address is wrong you end up in genuine limbo. Remember Forth is
; concrete and precise, no handwaving. I repeat it for clarity. If you
; type in a Forth word, it is looked up, and its machine code address is
; fetched. Then your Intel machine starts, for better or worse,
; executing the code at that address. There is no safety net. If that
; code doesn't cooperate with Forth-as-a-whole your machine crashes.
; (exercise)
;
; To an interpreter strings play of course an important role. Forth
; strings are represented as an address and a length. Putting two things
; on the stack is of course no problem. This may be unfamiliar for the
; c-programmer, but familiar for the Pascal programmer. Note that modern
; character encodings may contain embedded zero's, and several bytes may
; combine to represent glyph. yourforth doesn't care. If stored in
; memory the length occupies a whole cell, and the characters follow,
; one per byte, as far as this file is concerned. Counting those
; characters is a chore, as we will need a string for each name of a
; built in command.
; That chore is easily handled by the assembler using a macro.

macro string  content
{
    local startstring, endstring
    dd    endstring -startstring
startstring:
    db    content
endstring:
        align    cw
}

; "content" is of course the string itself, and fasm treats the start
; and the end of the string as locals, i.e. they are generated new for each
; string and are not visible outside the macro's.
; DD lays down a 32 bit value. It is short for DD, "define double (16-bits) word ".
; In yourforth a low of DD's are used, to represent headers as well as interpreted
; code. You see that we keep those cells aligned to 32 bit boundaries. This is
; not strictly necessary, but it makes inspecting memory so much easier.
; <I'm tempted to use a 'fix macro' to redefine DD as DC >

; The header macro lays down the 5 fields in memory. You don't need to understand
; the following fully yet. The details are introduced gradually as each type of
; definition will be explained where it first occurs.

; All fields are passed to the macro
; as is, except for the name that is passed as a string. The string is
; to be laid out in memory just like in the string macro and a pointer
; to that is put in the name field.

macro header dea, cfield,dfield,ffield,lfield,forthname
{
    local nfield, startstring, endstring
nfield:         dd    endstring -startstring
startstring:    db    forthname
endstring:
        align    cw
dea:  dd      cfield, dfield, ffield, lfield, nfield
lastlink EQU dea
}
; "header" makes one other thing easier. It is cumbersome to fill
; in lfield with the name of the previous definition. By setting
; lastlink -- changing it with every invocation of header -- the name of
; the previous definition is always available as "lastlink".
; So you will see that almost always all header specifies lastlink
; for lfield.
;; It is very inconvenient to fill in those linkfields by hand,
;; especially if you plan to move the code around. The header macro takes
;; this from our hands. We just always fill in "lastlink"
;;  and within
;; the macro lastlink is set to address of the new word,
;; ready to fill in into the next header.
;;
;; We can always override this by replacing
;; "lastlink" by the actual value we want to have.

; "dea" is the name used within the assembler. Remember forthname is a
; string like "+" that probably is not an acceptable name for the word
; in the assembler. So we need "dea" to use the word in the assembler.

; Here is the renaming convention:
; The capitals are kept, and if the resulting name clashes in the assembler,
; underscores are added before and after.
; Any special characters are replaced according to the following table.
; We'll have to write them out, like
; !     @     %        ,    *    (     <      >      /      +    -
; fetch store percent comma star paren less  greater slash  plus minus
;
; [        ~
; bracket  not
;
; Sometimes < and > are used to indicate data transfer and are then
; named to or from. I'm lazy and translate (CREATE) to paren_CREATE,
; not leftparen_CREATE_rightparen.
;
; fetch and store are used in forth names that fetch something from memory
; or store something in memory.
;
; A denotation, a constant value that is generated on the fly by
; the compiler or intepreter.
; Because this is difficult, we postpone it.

; The most important type of definitions are lowlevel code, high level code,
; low level objects(constants, variables/buffers) and high level objects.
; They are gradually introduced by example, but here is an overview of the
; different types. The names starting in "do" are assembler labels.
; - cfield contains docon. The definition is a constant, i.e. when executed it
;   puts a constant on the stack. That constant is present at the DFA.
; - cfield contains dobuf. The definition is a variable or buffer, i.e. when executed it
;    puts an address on the stack of an area where data can be stored.
;    That address is present at the DFA, typically dea+5*cw
; - cfield contains docol. docol is the interpreter of Forth. It takes care that
;   the high level code is executed, that is found via the DFA. This typically
;   contains dea+5*cw. In other words the high level code contained at the post
;   header address is executed. These are the ordinary functions.
; - cfield contains dea+5*cw. In other words, its machine code is
;   unique and contained at the post header address is to be executed.
;   These are the regular low level words that make up the Forth
;   language like "+" and "DROP". Of course this code is different for
;   all of those words.
; - cfield contains dodo. The Forth definition is generated using a CREATE DOES>
;   construct, Forth's poor man's objects of the 1970's. We will elaborate on this later.
;

;
;  The virtual machine reserves some of the Intel registers for its own.
;  In the first place we need an interpretation pointer, to keep track
;  of where we are in the interpreted code. It points to the -- high
;  level -- instruction that is to be executed after the current
;  definitions finishes. This is similar to the program counter in an
;  assembly program and we will use SI for it.
;  Then of course we need a data stack, for which we use
;  the intel stack, and the stack pointer is just SP.
;  This leaves us with the return stack, that is keeps track of
;  where we are when SI is needed to interpret another high
;  level definition from the current one. Intel has run out of stacks
;  already, but we can emulate a stack using the BP register.
;  It just means that we have to use a couple of instructions to push
;  SI, or pop it.
;
;  Within yourforth you have the constants DSP0 and RSP0 that contain
;  the initial stack pointers for the data and the return stack
;  respectively. [ ex. 2 ]
;   COLD is the Forth definition that starts
;  up Forth. So we load the registers SP and BP with the data field of
;  DSP0 and RSP0 and SI with the post header address of COLD, where its
;  Forth code resides. It ends with machine code that results in executing
;  the next Forth instruction. This is done all the time, so we have
;  a shorthand for it, called next.

macro   next {
        lodsd
        jmp     dword[eax]
}

; Now the choice for SI becomes clear. The lodsd instruction loads the dea
; from the instruction stream into EAX, and increments SI on the way,
; making it point to the next Forth instruction.
; [Actually this is a bit tricky. This requires that the socalled
; direction bit is set to forward, using the instruction cld. After
; executing the instruction std, lodsd is switched to decrementing.]
; Then we jump to what is contained in the code field of the dea, so actually
; [eax+0*cw] . We rely on that code to end again with a ``next'', and if
; it needs to use SI (e.g. for nesting), it must restore it beforehand.
; exercise with (CREATE)
; Executing the code is started with an eax that contains the dea of the
; word. So even if the code field is filled with the same pointer,
; the objects data is different and results in different data or even different
; action. Object buff's will recognize this, it is just a self pointer.

        cld     ; This direction must never change, or next stops working
        mov     esp, [DSP_zero+1*cw]
        mov     ebp, [RSP_zero+1*cw]
        mov     esi, COLD+5*cw
        next
;
; The following word is our first high level Forth word or "colon definition"
; in Forth speak.
header  BYE,   docol, BYE+5*cw, 0, FORTH, "BYE"
    dd      _zero_, _, _,   _one_, XOS
    dd      EXIT

; Executing this words means that the program jumps to address docol that takes
; care that SI is going to point to _zero_ , then does next.
; This is possible because eax contains the address BYE of this header
; as discussed with the description of the next macro.

docol:  lea     ebp,[ebp - 1*cw]        ; Push SI on the return stack
        mov     [ebp],esi
        mov     esi,[eax+1*cw]          ; Fill it with the data field
        next

; In the case of BYE the data field contains BYE+5*cw, which is the address
; that contains _zero_.
; So now we have it. Consecutively _zero_ _ _ _one XOS and EXIT are executed.
; The word XOS finds 0 X X 1 on the stack, which instructs it to do linux
; system call 1 (an exit) with one parameter 0 and two dummy parameters.
; This ends the Forth session with a status code of 0, meaning okay. (exercise).

; [One last remark. Because BYE is our first definition, you may expect it to
; have a link of 0 and to be it last in the linked list. But we want the
; word FORTH and the denotations to come last yet not discuss them until later.]
;
; EXIT is the reverse of docol. ( In the above case EXIT is not reached.)
; This is our first example of a low level word, or "code definition".
; You see that we use our lastlink trick as described with the header macro.

    header  EXIT,   EXIT+5*cw, 0, 0, lastlink, "EXIT"
        mov     esi,[ebp]               ; Pop SI from the return stack
        lea     ebp,[ebp+1*cw]
        next

; The next executed at the end of the FORTH instruction before EXIT,
; jumps to EXIT+5*cw which is the mov instruction.
; So EXIT just abandons the current SI and loads it with what docol has left.
; Note that the data field is not used and the content of AX is not used.

; Because you understand Intel assembly language a bit, I present you
; ;; with a table of the 5 instructions of the virtual machine:
;     Forth machine      cells            Intel equivalent
;     DEA, invocation     1               call XXX
;     EXIT                1               rts
;     BRANCH rel          2               jr rel
;     0BRANCH rel         2               jz rel
;     LIT value           2               pushi value
;     expandable          your choice     whatever
;
; That is all there is to it. If it seems few,
; let me remind you that all operations like + fall under the
; invocation of a definition. The conditional jump can be used to
; construct if-endif's (called IF THEN 's in Forth) and begin-until's.
; Together with the unconditional jump you can have all control
; constructs.  EXIT BRANCH 0BRANCH LIT are the names of actual
; definitions in the dictionary. Their invocation is the same as
; for just any DEA.
; I put in the last line to remind you that this is not the end if it.
; You can add basic constructs e.g. special looping constructs later.
; You can use assembler language in defining it, and you can do this
; in a separate file, that you will choose to include, or not.
; FIXME: actual those looping are still built in.

; LIT does something very similar to next, it fetches
; the cell from SI with auto increment, using the now familiar
; lodsd instruction. Now we have to put that on the data stack.
    header  LIT,   LIT+5*cw, 0, 0, lastlink, "LIT"
        lodsd
        push    eax
        next

; BRANCH also fetches a cell in line that serves as an offset to SI.
; The three instruction
; following round it up to a multiple of cw, an action that is called
; alignment. Why that is done, we'll come back to later.
; Normally the offset is a multiple of cw and nothing happens.

; the code following is executed. Otherwise we skip to "label".

; is part of the loop, so we stay in the loop. The label is where we want

; For untilto the code following is outside of a loop, so we jump out.
