This is yourforth : a compiler and scripter for the Forth language.
Building the compiler from the single assembler file is surprisingly
easy and the elaborate documentation, in the style of "literate
programming", invites modifications, hence the name yourforth.
The goal is to provide you with insight into how a compiler can be implemented.
A set of exercises guides you if you want to go hands on.
All the rest is available in the assembler file yourforth.fas.

Making your own Forth may be the true spirit, we don't loose track of the fact
that Forth is a standardized language. Compared to ISO Forth, yourforth has
a few omissions and still fewer small incompatibilities, documented separately.

I don't know whether you are familiar with programming from a text
console. There are a few things related to that collected in
